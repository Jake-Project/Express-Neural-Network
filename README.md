# Application Description

A  simple Express Application which is capable of running different tests for me to learn how Neural networks work.

## Brief Explanation Of Technical Terminology

- Perceptron
 - Single Layer Neural Network.
 - Can also be described as a Neuron.
 - Has inputs, a Bias Function and an output.
 - Before the output there is always an Activation Function which determines the output.

- Input
 - A value which is fed into the Neural Networks hidden Layers.

- Output
 - A value which is returned out of the Neural Network.

- Layers
 - A stack of Neurons which process data but are not connected to each other. They are only connected to the previous inputs/neurons and the next layer which is either outputs/neurons.

- Hidden Layers
 - A series of Neuron's which feed data into the next layer of the network which are connected by weights

- Bias Function
 - !!IMPORTANT!! In my neural network Bias Functions will be represented by a neuron from the pervious layer which has no previous connections.
 - Do not have incoming connections, only outgoing weights and values.

- Activation Function
 - A function which creates a linear/non-linear connection which changes the output.
 - An example of this is using the Binary Activation Function which gives an output of 0 if the Neuron's calculated value < 0 or 1 if the value is > 0.

Any parts of the Readme which have not been filled in do not have any functionality. This is an ongoing project which is a sideline to my current studies at Aberystwyth University
